# Consistent Localization Final Mix

This mod is part of a series intended to make subtle adjustments to the English localizations of the Kingdom Hearts games so that they better align with one another.

## Installation

Mod can be installed using the OpenKH Mod Manager. Simply open the Mod Manager, click the green + button, type `SuperfieldCU/ConsistentLocalizationKH1` into the text box, then click `Install`.

The GitHub version of this mod functions identically to using the .kh1pcpatch version of the mod on Nexus Mods (this is in contrast to the KH2 version of Consistent Localization, where the .kh2pcpatch version and GitHub versions function very differently). Use whichever you'd like, although this version gets automatic updates and looks better within the Mod Manager interface.

The mod was developed and tested using the OpenKH Mod Manager. It works both with patching the files directly and using Panacea. It is tested and confirmed to be compatible with Re:Fined v3.15.

## Links
If you do not use the OpenKH Mod Manager or prefer to use .kh1pcpatch files in favor of GitHub repos, you can download the mod from Nexus Mods:
